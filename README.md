# SBSPS-Challenge-677-RASP-AI-Recriter

Hello Everyone!

We have created a prototype for an AI Recruiter which makes the shortlisting of candidates for a specific job easier.

We have used NODE-RED to create the User Interface, Watson Assistant to create the chat bot and Cloudant to store our records in IBM Platform.

We have also given a link to see the demo of our project.

To view the project follow the steps given below:

Step 1: Import the UI_FLOW.json and Answers_FLOW.json files to your node-red editor. 

Step 2: Create Job application assistant in watson assistant.

Step 3: Import the skill-Job-Application skill.

Step 4: Repeat the same steps to create Knock out questions bot with skill-KnockoutQuestion.

Step 5: Update the cloudant and watson assitant credentials in the node-red files and deploy it.

Step 6: Inject the timestamps in the Answers_FLOW.json file in order to store the answers to the database.

Step 7: Inject the first timestamp in the UI_FLOW.json file. 

Step 8: Follow the steps in the demo video.
